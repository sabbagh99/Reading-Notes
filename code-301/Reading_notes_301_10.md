# The Call Stack and Debugging

## This reading is very important to me beuacse since we start learning in beckend I'am wandarion how i can use debugging.

# A) Call stack:
 
### A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions.

> ### How the call back works?!
1. when  we add a function in the script  and run this script we adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
2.  Any function called that function this will add it to the call stack  and run it when reach that call.

### The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

# B) Error messages:
### First  to know what the problhem is we need to know what is erorr type we have after we know what type of error we have we can now start working on this problehm.
