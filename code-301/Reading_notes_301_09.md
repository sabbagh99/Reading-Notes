# A) FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING.

### This reads for today lecture.

>   ## what is the meaning of functional programming ?! 
### Functional programming is a programming paradigm â€” a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs.


### If we want to understand functional programming we need to know the first consept of it and this consept is pure function 

> ## So what is the meaning of pure function ?!

### First we need to know if our function is pure or not by :

1. If the function returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
2. If does not cause any observable side effects.

# B) Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability.


### We usually do  Refactoring  for JavaScript  to make our code more readable and and short and easy to understand by outher devoloper so we can do that by using function that help us to make use it mutipule  times and help us to make the code better.

 > In this [link](https://dev.to/healeycodes/refactoring-javascript-for-performance-and-readability-with-examples-1hec) we have example, Scenario and Strategies  to show us how we can apply this things.
