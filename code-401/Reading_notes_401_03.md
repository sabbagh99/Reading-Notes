# Day(3)

# Maps, primitives, File I/O

## Primitives V.S Objects:

* ## Java Type System.

### We hava two fild type system in java consisting of primitives such as int, boolean and reference types such as Integer, Boolean.

### Also we can do a conversion between the primitive and reference types, we have two type of conversion :

1. #### Autoboxing : converting a primitive type to a reference one.

2. #### Unboxing : converting a reference type to a primitive one.

* ## Pros and Cons.

### We need to pay attintion  to the defferint in the size for the primitive and  reference type beacause in convarting its very important to know.


# Exceptions in Java.

### What Is an Exception?

* ####  Exception is  like a error  massage  that appeer when you have somthing goes wrong and if that happend we need to habdle in we can do that by using try and catch.

### What is happen when an error occurs within a method?

* #### If that happen the method will creates a mssage have the error and the type of it and send it to the user.

## The Catch or Specify Requirement

* ### In this part it's telling what happen when the code throw a certain exceptions. the first thing we can do by a try statement that catches the exception. The try must provide a handler for the exception,or  a method that specifies that it can throw the exception. The method must provide a throws clause that lists the exception.

## Catching and Handling Exceptions.

* ### In this section I learned how how to use the exception handler components.

# Scanning

### We can do many thing using scanner like reading a files and we can checking or search for spisfic things.
