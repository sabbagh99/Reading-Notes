### There's some concepts we need to know to understand to use Amazon S3 effectively;


#### 1. Buckets :

##### Every object is contained in a bucket and with Buckets we can  serve several purposes:

    They organize the Amazon S3 namespace at the highest level.

    They identify the account responsible for storage and data transfer charges.

    They play a role in access control.

    They serve as the unit of aggregation for usage reporting.

#### 2. Objects :

##### it's a bunch of data and metadata and the metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object.


#### 3. Keys: every object within a bucket have a unique key  identifier and each object have one key 

#### 4. Regions : with AWS Region we can  choose the geographical  where Amazon S3 will store the buckets that you create.
