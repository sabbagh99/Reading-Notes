# Stacks and Queues.

### A) What is the meaing of the stack ?

#### it's a data stucture type and it's contain nodes each node have a refrence with the next node in the stack.

### Stacks follow these concepts:

* #### **F**irst **I**n **L**ast **O**ut (FILO).

* #### **L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O** (LIFO)

### Stack Visualization :
#### 1. push : when we push something to the stack it's become the new top 
#### 2. Pop : when we pop a node in the stack this action will remove the node from the top
#### 3. Peek : when we want to get the peek just we need to use top.value and return it.
#### 4. isEmpty : here we need just to check if the value for the equel null.

### B) What is a Queue?
> ####  "Queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue)."

### Queue follow these concepts:
* #### **F**irst **I**n **F**irst **O**ut : (FIFO).
* #### **L**ast **I**n **L**ast **O**ut : (LILO).

### Queue Visualization :

#### 1.Enqueue : when we wabt to add itme in the we  need to use this action.

#### 2.Dequeue : when we need to remove item from queue we can use this action 

#### 3. Peek : when we want to get the peek just we need to use top.value and return it.

#### 4. isEmpty : here we need just to check if the value for the equel null.
