# OO Design.

## A) SOLID 

### We need to know SOLID what is stand for and whis is the meainig of each principle.

### SOLID stands for:


* ### *S* - Single-responsiblity Principle.(SRP)

    - #### The meanig of SRP that each class should have one only job, so you should hava multi class and each one do certen thing and in create class call some method from the other class to do something commen.

* ### *O* - Open-closed Principle.
    - #### The meaning of this consept that the Objects or entities can be open for adding on it but closed for modification, to do that we need to use interface and implemnt from other class.


* ### *L* - Liskov Substitution Principle.
>    - "Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class."

* ### *I* - Interface Segregation Principle.
    - #### The purpose of using interface is  use less code by implement multi method for example in one interface. 

* ### *D* - Dependency Inversion Principle.
    - #### This part called  Dependency because it's depend on abstractions.
