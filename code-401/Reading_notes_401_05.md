## What is a Linked List?

### It's a node have a connetion or linked to the next node. 

### And we have two type of linked list the first one is *singly* which is refer to numbers that the node have and this number have one refrance which it's the next one in the linked list, second one is the *Doubly* and its refar tow double number and this number have a connection for the next and previous one in the linked list.

### What is the *Node*?
> ### "Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link."

### We have two proparty for the linked list the first one is the *head* and it's spicfy the first node, *Current* this proparty spacify the current node that you are in.

### To loop in linked list we cant use for or foreach to do that there is a proparty called *Next* you can use it in the *Current* node to leed you to the next node.
