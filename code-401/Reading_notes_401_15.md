# Trees

## In this read we will summaries three types of trees Which is Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and K-ary Trees

### 1. Common Terminology: 

> * #### "Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes"

> * ####  "Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree"

> * ####  "K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2."

> * ####  "Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree"

> * ####  "Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree"

> * ####  "Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node"

> * ####  "Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children"

> * ####  "Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf"

### 2. Traversals : If we want to deal with trees we need to know how we can Traversals, and there is  two categories of traversals which is Depth First and Breadth First.

#### In the Depth First  we have three  three methods for traversal:

* ##### Pre-order: `root >> left >> right`

* ##### In-order: `left >> root >> right`

* ##### Post-order: `left >> right >> root`

#### In the Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-nodeز
