# Graphs 

## What is graphs?

### " A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges."

## common terminology in graphs we need to know :

### 1. Vertex  - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

### 2. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

### 3. Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

### 4. Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected

* ### Directed Graphs (Digraph): is a graph where every edge is directed.

* ### Undirected Graphs :  is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional.

## We have two type of graphs :

### 1. Complete Graphs: A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

### 2. Connected : A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

### 3. Disconnected : A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic


### 1. Acyclic Graph : An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

### 2.Cyclic Graphs : A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

## Graph Representation 

### we can representation graph in two way :

#### 1. Adjacency Matrix : An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

#### 2. Adjacency List  : An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.
